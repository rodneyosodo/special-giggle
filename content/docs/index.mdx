[**Propeller**](https://propeller.absmach.eu) is a cutting-edge orchestrator for **WebAssembly (Wasm)** workloads across the **Cloud-Edge continuum**. It enables seamless deployment of Wasm applications from powerful cloud servers to constrained microcontrollers, combining flexibility, security, and performance.

## Features

- **Cloud-Edge Orchestration**: Deploy Wasm workloads effortlessly across diverse environments, from robust cloud servers to lightweight microcontrollers.
- **Fast Boot Times**: Take advantage of Wasm's near-instant startup for efficient workload execution.
- **FaaS Deployment**: Enable Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) capabilities for scalable and event-driven applications.
- **OCI Registry Support**: Push and pull Wasm workloads from OCI-compliant registries for streamlined workflow integration.
- **WAMR on Zephyr RTOS**: Deploy lightweight Wasm workloads on constrained devices running Zephyr RTOS via the WebAssembly Micro Runtime (WAMR).
- **Powerful Service Mesh**: Integrates with [**SuperMQ**](https://github.com/absmach) for secure, efficient IoT device communication.
- **Security at the Core**: Propeller ensures secure workload execution and communication for IoT environments.
- **Federated Learning**: Built-in support for federated machine learning workflows with FedAvg aggregation, enabling privacy-preserving distributed training across edge devices.
- **Job Orchestration**: Group multiple tasks into jobs with configurable execution modes (parallel, sequential, or dependency-based), enabling complex multi-step workflows with fail-fast semantics.

## How It Works

1. **Develop in WebAssembly**: Write portable, lightweight Wasm workloads for your application.
2. **Register Workloads**: Push your workloads to an OCI-compliant registry for easy deployment.
3. **Deploy Anywhere**: Use Propeller to orchestrate and manage workload deployment across the cloud, edge, and IoT devices.
4. **Monitor & Scale**: Leverage real-time monitoring and dynamic scaling to optimize your system's performance.

## Use Cases

- **Industrial IoT**: Deploy analytics or control applications to edge devices in factories.
- **Secure Workloads**: Run isolated, portable workloads securely on cloud or edge devices.
- **Smart Cities**: Power scalable IoT networks with efficient communication and dynamic workloads.
- **Serverless Applications**: Deploy FaaS applications leveraging Propeller's Wasm orchestration capabilities.
- **Federated Machine Learning**: Train machine learning models across distributed edge devices without exposing raw data, perfect for privacy-sensitive applications.
